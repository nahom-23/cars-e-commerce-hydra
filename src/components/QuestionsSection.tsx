      question: "How Do I Know If a Part Fits My Vehicle?",
      answer: "This is the third item's accordion body. It is hidden by default, until the collapse plugin adds the appropriate classes that we use to style each element. These classes control the overall appearance, as well as the showing and hiding via CSS transitions. You can modify any of this with custom CSS or overriding our default variables. It's also worth noting that just about any HTML can go within the accordion-body, though the transition does limit overflow."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I Save Multiple Vehicles in My Garage?",
      answer: "Yes, you can save multiple vehicles in your garage. Our system allows you to store vehicle information for easy part lookup and compatibility checking across all your vehicles."

      question: "What Does \"Ignavo\" Mean in Auto Parts?",

    },
    {
      question: "Are Aftermarket Parts Reliable?",
      answer: "Aftermarket parts can be highly reliable when sourced from reputable manufacturers. Many aftermarket parts meet or exceed OEM specifications and often come with warranties comparable to original parts."

      question: "Can I Return a Part If It Doesn't Fit?",
      answer: "Yes, we offer a comprehensive return policy for parts that don't fit. Items must be in original condition and packaging, and returns are typically accepted within 30 days of purchase."
